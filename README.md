### Some Zola with Gatsby

👉 http://gatsby.rougon-macquart.com/

This is a simple open source website about [Les Rougon-Macquart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Rougon-Macquart) by [Emile Zola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Zola).

This well known french literature saga holds 20 books and more than a thousand characters.

Copying/pasting their bios in a WordPress before my coding days was kind of a lengthy hobby, but I ended with the perfect project to tryout new stuff!

After WordPress AngularJS and [Hugo](https://github.com/regisphilibert/rougon), this repo is its [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) port.
